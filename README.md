**Self-Introduction and Motivation:**  

Hello, this is SIYU YAN and I am a master student majoring in Applied Statistics. 
This is my second semester at Cornell and I am expected to graduate May, 2015.

The predictive modeling part of Bayesian statistical methods is the main reason that I am interested in this course. 
I did a class project on Predicting Mr. Obama's chance of winning 2012's Presidential Election from my undergrduate studies, 
back in late 2012. 

This is a snapshot of a sample of the polls data from 
www.realclearpolitics.com.

Besides politics, I am also interested the application of Bayesian methods in the fields of astronomy 
and healthcare (clinical trials).
